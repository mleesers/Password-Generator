The project was to create a password generator using javascript.
I first added a prompt function which would get what the user wanted in the password.
If they want whichever character in their passwrd then the program gets a random character from the 
connected function and appends it to an array 
The program then picks a random character from that array and adds it to the password
This process repeats until the amount of characters the user wanted is reached
